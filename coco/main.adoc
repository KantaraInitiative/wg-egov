== Introduction

This document (Report: Code of Conduct for Relying Parties) provides supporting guidance to the controlling documents of the Kantara Initiative Identity Assurance Framework (IAF) so that, in the fullness of time, the IAF and its controlling document suite could be extended to include the role of Relying Parties (RPs).

The intended audience for this document are Trust Framework operators that may require requirements for RPs be specified.

A complete Code of Conduct for Relying Parties, that spans the full extent of a RP&#39;s policies, processes and procedures, might include Sections such as the following:

1. Data Protection,
2. Admin, Record Keeping and Process,
3. Audit and Compliance,
4. Exit and Off Boarding and
5. Marketing

It should be noted that other aspects, applicable to a given context or domain, might be required to make it comprehensive.

At this time the document is not intended to be a complete set of requirements for good behaviour of a RP. Rather, it is intended to give pointers to the range of topics that should typically be addressed in describing this set of requirements. A few exemplars have been provided for some of the topics.

== On conceptualizing a typical Table of Contents for a code of Conduct for Relying Parties

This document offers an insight into what a typical Code of Conduct for Replying Parties might contain by presenting a draft Table of Contents.  Further, it assumes that the Code of Conduct for Relying Parties would form just one component of a larger document suite (e.g., the IAF) covering other aspects of federated identity activities.

It assumes that the following artefacts and conditions exist in that broader framework document set for the federation:

1. a set of agreed definitions/terminology,
2. Scope and specification of the Replying Party activities,
3. a legal contract in force to make all obligations clear for interpretation,
4. that a federated trust framework is operating, and
5. that a quality ISMS is operating in the RP/AP environments..

With the above conditions met, a Table of Contents for the Code of Conduct for Relying Parties aspect of the document set might include:

- Introduction and Purpose
- Executive Summary
- Assumptions
- Definitions/Terminology
- References and bibliography
- Activities in scope for the Relying Party
- Data Protection\*
- Administration, Record Keeping and processes/procedures\*
- Audit and Compliance
- Exit and Off boarding\*
- Marketing

(note: example text for this topic has been drafted below)

3. [Data minimisation] to minimise the Attributes requested from a party to the Federation to those that are adequate, relevant and not excessive for enabling access to the service and, where a number of Attributes could be used to provide access to the service, to use the least intrusive Attributes possible;
